OVERALL FINDINGS
----------------
1. Hyperbolic embeddings become increasingly advantageous with deeper hierarchies
2. The advantage is particularly evident in preserving parent-child relationships
3. Hyperbolic space maintains better precision even with fewer dimensions
4. The Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) improvements indicate hyperbolic embeddings place relevant results higher in the results list
5. For data with natural hierarchical structure, hyperbolic embeddings offer meaningful improvements in retrieval quality
