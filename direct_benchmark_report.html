    <h2>Applications for Database Query Optimization</h2>
    <p>
        The results of this benchmark have significant implications for database query optimization:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Schema relationships can be more efficiently represented in hyperbolic space</li>
        <li>Query execution paths with natural hierarchies benefit from hyperbolic embeddings</li>
        <li>Memory usage can be reduced by using lower-dimensional hyperbolic representations</li>
        <li>Nearest-neighbor lookups for similar queries are more accurate in hyperbolic space</li>
        <li>Complex join operations on hierarchical data can be optimized using hyperbolic distances</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Hyperbolic embeddings offer clear advantages for representing hierarchical data structures
        encountered in database systems. The natural geometry of hyperbolic space aligns with the
        exponential growth characteristics of tree-like structures, making it an ideal choice for
        query optimization tasks involving schema relationships, execution plans, and similar queries.
    </p>
    <p>
        For e6data's query optimization engine, implementing hyperbolic embeddings could provide
        significant improvements in both performance and memory efficiency, particularly for complex
        queries involving multiple joins and nested structures.
