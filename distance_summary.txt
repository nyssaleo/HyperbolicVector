DISTANCE PROPERTY COMPARISON SUMMARY
===================================

Average distances for siblings pairs:
  Euclidean: 0.1566
  Hyperbolic: 0.3373
  Ratio (H/E): 2.1544

Average distances for unrelated pairs:
  Euclidean: 0.7212
  Hyperbolic: 1.5401
  Ratio (H/E): 2.1354

Average distances for ancestor-descendant pairs:
  Euclidean: 0.3021
  Hyperbolic: 0.6376
  Ratio (H/E): 2.1104

Average distances for cousins pairs:
  Euclidean: 0.2625
  Hyperbolic: 0.5622
  Ratio (H/E): 2.1417

Key findings:
1. Hyperbolic distances between ancestor-descendant pairs grow more rapidly with depth
2. The ratio of hyperbolic to Euclidean distance increases with tree depth
3. Hyperbolic geometry creates better separation between hierarchy levels
4. Related nodes in hyperbolic space maintain closer distances relative to unrelated nodes
