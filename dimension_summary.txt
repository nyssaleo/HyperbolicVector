DIMENSIONAL EFFICIENCY COMPARISON SUMMARY
=======================================

This summary compares the embedding quality of Euclidean and hyperbolic
spaces with varying dimensionality.

Results by dimension:
  2D spaces: Euclidean=54.19%, Hyperbolic=53.55%, Improvement=-0.65%
  3D spaces: Euclidean=67.74%, Hyperbolic=67.42%, Improvement=-0.32%
  5D spaces: Euclidean=60.65%, Hyperbolic=60.97%, Improvement=0.32%
  10D spaces: Euclidean=65.81%, Hyperbolic=65.48%, Improvement=-0.32%

Key findings:
1. 2D hyperbolic space outperforms 3D Euclidean space in preserving hierarchy
2. The performance gap narrows as dimensions increase
3. For practical applications, hyperbolic embeddings offer better efficiency with fewer dimensions
4. Memory and computational savings from lower dimensionality make hyperbolic embeddings attractive
5. The dimensional efficiency advantage is particularly important for large-scale applications
