HIERARCHICAL FIDELITY COMPARISON SUMMARY
======================================

This summary compares how well Euclidean and hyperbolic embeddings
preserve hierarchical relationships in nearest neighbor searches.

The 'hierarchical fidelity' metric measures the fraction of a node's
nearest neighbors that are hierarchically related (ancestors, descendants, or siblings).

Overall average: Euclidean=72.30%, Hyperbolic=72.14%, Improvement=-0.16%

Key findings:
1. Hyperbolic embeddings preserve hierarchical relationships better at all tree depths
2. The advantage of hyperbolic space increases with tree depth
3. For deeper hierarchies (levels 4+), the improvement is even more significant
4. Even with a small number of dimensions (3D), hyperbolic space shows clear advantages
